# Android Kotlin Demo Parallel Decomposition Using Coroutines Async Await

Parallel decomposition is a technique used in software development to speed up the execution of a program by splitting it into smaller, independent parts that can be executed concurrently. In Kotlin, this can be achieved using coroutines, which provide an easy and efficient way to write asynchronous and non-blocking code.

To use coroutines for parallel decomposition, we can use the async and await functions, which allow us to launch multiple coroutines and wait for their results to be computed.
